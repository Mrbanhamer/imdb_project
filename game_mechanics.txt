The player should have choices and these are the choices they are able to do.
    -fight
    -talk to npc
    -pick up items
    -walk to a destination

this is a list of things the player should be able to do when i have some time over (i honestly think i only have time for trade with npc).
    -pickpocket
    -trade with npc
    -have companions

these are some properties the player should have.
    -HP = health, when this reaches zero the game ends (unless there is some form of revive)
    -gold = currency, will only add this if there is trading in the game
    -inventory system, a place to keep your items
    -dialgouge options, so you can talk to the npc

items included should be able to do atleast one of these things.
    -be a weapon and do damage
    -something that can heal
